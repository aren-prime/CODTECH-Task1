PROJECT : PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION
Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy

# Car Selling Price Prediction

This project involves predicting the selling price of a car using linear regression. The dataset used contains various attributes of the cars, and the model aims to provide an accurate estimate of the selling price based on these features.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build a linear regression model to predict the selling price of a car given its features. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.

## Key Points

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Model Training**: Training a linear regression model on the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using various metrics.
- **Visualization**: Plotting the regression line and comparing actual vs. predicted values.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the entire project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- `Car_Name`: Name of the car
- `Year`: Year of manufacture
- `Selling_Price`: Price at which the car is being sold (target variable)
- `Present_Price`: Current ex-showroom price of the car
- `Kms_Driven`: Distance driven by the car in kilometers
- `Fuel_Type`: Type of fuel used by the car (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)
- `Seller_Type`: Type of seller (Dealer, Individual)
- `Transmission`: Transmission type (Manual, Automatic)
- `Owner`: Number of previous owners

## Project Structure

- `car.txt`: The dataset file.
- `car_price_prediction.py`: The main script containing data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
- `README.md`: This readme file.

## Results

- The regression line showing the relationship between present price and selling price.
- A plot comparing the actual vs. predicted selling prices.
- Model performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R² score.
